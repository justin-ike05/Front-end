    <h2>Carbohydrates</h2>
    <p>Carbohydrates are a type of nutrient that provide energy for the body. They are found in foods like bread, rice, fruits, and vegetables. When you eat carbohydrates, your body breaks them down into sugar (glucose), which gives you energy for daily activities. There are two main types: simple carbs (like sugar) that give quick energy, and complex carbs (like whole grains) that provide longer-lasting energy.

<h2>Protein</h2>
<p>Proteins are nutrients that help build and repair the body's tissues, like muscles, skin, and organs. They are made up of smaller building blocks called amino acids. You get proteins from foods like meat, fish, eggs, beans, and nuts. Your body needs proteins to grow, stay strong, and function properly.
